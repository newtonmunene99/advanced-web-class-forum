This is a forum where students can post questions and get comments and answers to their questions.

## Getting started

I've used:

6. css

## Setup

1. Create a db called csc316 on your server.
2. Make sure to change database connection string in `control.php` if necessary.
3. Import `csc316.sql`,which is at the root of this project, into your database.
